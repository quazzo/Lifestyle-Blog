 <p>Welcome to our completely accurate not at all embellished blog of life at 7D Greyfriars. Our home has become a refuge from the stresses of student life. We focus on Food, Friends and Far Away places, all of which we regard as of the utmost importance to a healthy balanced life. Dive into these pages and find what has been cooking in the 7D kitchen, what our friends are like and what amazing places we have been able to visit! We would love to hear from you on what you think we should be creating in the kitchen next and what spots to add to our vacation wish list!

  	We would like to thank Code First: Girls for inspiring this blog and giving us the tools to make it. We never could have imagined being able to express ourselves and our lives in this way. While still coding newbs, we have learned that half of coding is perserverence, that google is our friend and that with basic knowledge and a little luck, we are able to surprise ourselves. Special thank you to Sjoukje, Zoe and all our other teachers- you guys answered countless questions and were able to make coding relatable despite our art student background. We hope to continue coding, creating and sharing! xx
